# Rinne

**Local, open-source, terminal-first AI orchestration.**

### Crates Version - 0.1.6

Rinne is a CLI harness you talk to directly. You tell it what you want done; it plans the work into a graph, distributes that work across the AI coding tools and model APIs already on your machine, and drives it to completion through a verifying generator–evaluator loop. You never open Claude Code, Codex, Grok, or OpenCode yourself — you live in Rinne, and it reaches down to those tools as workers.

The orchestration idea is a *conductor* composing a pool of models into ad-hoc teams. The execution model is a durable *loop* with state on disk. Rinne unifies them: the conductor composes a per-task team, the loop drives long-running work and verification, and the filesystem is the shared substrate that lets heterogeneous workers collaborate.

> Status: v0.1, actively built. Single-machine, single-user. No hosted component, no telemetry, no accounts.

## Why Rinne

You already pay for one or more coding-agent subscriptions, or you hold raw API keys, or both. Rinne extracts multi-model orchestration value from that spend **without charging again and without metering**, except where you deliberately use a paid API worker.

It is built for:

- **Subscription users with no API budget** — get multi-model orchestration out of capacity you already bought (Claude Pro/Max, ChatGPT, etc.).
- **API-key users** — a clean local orchestrator over raw model access.
- **Anyone mixing both** — e.g. a cheap API model as the evaluator and a subscription harness as the generator.

## Principles

These are locked.

- **Local only.** Runs on your machine. No hosted component, ever.
- **Open source.** No pricing, no tiers, no accounts.
- **No telemetry, no data fetching.** The only network calls are the worker calls and the conductor backend you configured.
- **Rinne holds no credentials in plaintext.** Each worker is installed and logged in by you the normal way. API keys are stored in your OS keychain (an approved, encrypted deviation) — never written to config files.
- **Terminal-first.** No app, no web UI. A CLI that controls other CLIs.
- **Routing is always narrated, never hidden.** Every routing decision is explained in the transcript.

## Features

- **Conductor planning** — turns a prompt into a JSON DAG of tasks; picks granularity (one node for easy tasks, multi-node graphs with evaluator loops for hard ones).
- **Verifying loop** — generator → evaluator → loop-back with critique, until the goal is met or the budget runs out. Evaluators can be AI, a tool (e.g. tests), or you.
- **Two worker families, one contract** — autonomous harness CLIs *and* raw model APIs, mixed freely in a single plan.
- **Pool-aware tiered routing** — tiers and escalation computed from whatever workers are actually present; a node never dies because its preferred worker is rate-limited.
- **Fully dynamic API support** — any OpenAI-compatible provider, any base URL, any number of keys (rotated across rate limits). Connect-time verification surfaces bad keys/endpoints immediately.
- **Model discovery** — `rinne models <provider>` lists what a key can actually reach, cheapest-first where pricing is reported.
- **Inline TUI** — the transcript goes to native terminal scrollback; a small live viewport shows the plan tree, the active worker's stream, conductor narration, and the prompt.
- **`@`-file mentions** — fuzzy picker over the repo; references are resolved to paths (for harnesses) or inlined as contents (for API workers).
- **Tab-completion** — slash commands and `/config` subcommands/values complete as you type.
- **Persistent, format-preserving config** — view and edit everything via `/config` subcommands or by hand-editing a scaffolded, validated TOML file.
- **Doctor** — detects installed workers, their auth mode (subscription / api-key / free), and warns about metered-billing footguns.

```

In one sentence: you prompt Rinne, the conductor turns the prompt plus current state into a JSON DAG, the loop engine schedules that DAG across workers through the blackboard, evaluators gate each result, and the conductor re-plans when something fails — until the goal is met or the budget runs out.

The five crates of the workspace map onto this:

| Crate | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `rinne-cli` | Binary entry point, the inline TUI, headless `-p` mode, all subcommands |
| `rinne-core` | Loop engine, DAG/plan model, blackboard, context assembler, the `Worker` contract |
| `rinne-conductor` | Prompt assembly, plan parsing, conductor backends (`PlanBackend`) |
| `rinne-workers` | Worker adapters (harness subprocess + OpenAI-compatible HTTP) and transports |
| `rinne-config` | Layered config, the worker/provider catalogs, doctor probing, keychain secrets |

## How a run works

1. **Plan.** The conductor receives the goal, a digest of the blackboard (plan, progress, repo summary, prior outputs), the resolved `@`-mentions, and the worker registry. It emits a **JSON DAG**: nodes with dependency edges. It assigns each node a **role** and a **capability requirement** plus an *optional* preferred worker — it does not hard-bind a concrete worker.
2. **Schedule.** The loop engine resolves the concrete worker for each ready node at dispatch time, from live availability and quota. Independent nodes run in parallel.
3. **Assemble context.** For a **harness** worker, mentioned files are pinned as *paths* (the worker reads the repo itself). For an **API** worker, their *contents are inlined* (the model only sees what is sent).
4. **Execute.** The worker streams events (reading/editing/tool-use/message) into the live viewport.
5. **Evaluate.** A node's `evaluator` (AI / tool / human) gates the result.
6. **Loop or replan.** On failure, the node's `on_fail` policy applies: `loop_back` to a prior node with critique, hand to a `fixer`, or `replan` the whole DAG. A stuck loop escalates to you.
7. **Finish.** The run completes, parks for a human decision, or stops at the budget.

**Roles:** `planner`, `generator`, `evaluator`, `synthesizer`, `fixer`.
**Evaluator kinds:** `ai`, `tool`, `human`.
**On-fail policies:** `loop_back(node[, critique])`, `loop_with(node)`, `fixer`, `replan`.

Generator–evaluator is not a special structure — it is just a pair of nodes with a loop-back edge.

## Workers

Anything that takes a subtask and does it. Two families, one contract.

- **Harness workers** wrap a native headless call that honors your existing login (e.g. `claude -p`, `codex exec`). They are autonomous agents: hand them a chunky self-contained task and they do their own file reading and editing.
- **API workers** are direct OpenAI-compatible model calls on your own key. They are raw models: hand them a precise instruction with context assembled inline, get back one focused result.

### Harnesses (auto-detected once installed + logged in)

| Name | Login | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `claude-code` | `claude` (sign in once; subscription honored) | ⚠ if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set it overrides the subscription and bills the API account — Rinne warns |
| `codex` | `codex login` (ChatGPT login or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) | |
| `opencode` | `opencode auth login` | |
| `grok` | `grok login` (or `XAI_API_KEY`) | |
| `cursor-agent` | `cursor-agent login` | |
| `aider` | provider key env var (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) | |
| `antigravity` | `agy` (Google OAuth on first run) | |

Enable/disable harnesses via `[backends.harness] enabled = [...]` in config.

### API providers (built-in catalog)

`openai`, `deepseek`, `gemini`, `nvidia`, `groq`, `openrouter`, `mistral`, `together`, `xai`.

Each maps to a default base URL and key env var, but **any** OpenAI-compatible provider works — pass `--base-url` to point a custom name at any host. Connect with `rinne connect <provider> <key>`.

## The conductor

The brain that plans and routes. It does no work itself and runs prompted on a **cheap, decoupled backend** so planning never burns the quota meant for real work. All backends are OpenAI-compatible, so one HTTP client covers them.

| Backend | Default model | Key (env or keychain) | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `cloudflare` | `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` | `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | needs `account_id`; free daily neuron tier |
| `groq` | (set one) | `GROQ_API_KEY` | fast planning |
| `nvidia` | (set one) | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | NIM, trial credits |
| `local` | (set one) | none | Ollama, fully offline |
| `harness` | n/a | none | uses your cheapest installed harness as planner |

**Resolution:** the configured backend is used **if its key resolves** (env first, then keychain); otherwise Rinne falls back to a harness planner. The fallback **chains across every installed harness** in order — if the first (say `claude`) exits non-zero, it tries the next (say `antigravity`) before giving up, and only errors if all fail (with the failing worker's actual output, not a bare exit code). Check what's active with `rinne config`.

### Use a model as the conductor (recommended)

Relying on an installed harness to plan works, but it ties planning to a heavyweight CLI that can be slow, rate-limited, or fail for auth/flag reasons. **Point the conductor at a cheap or free model instead** — planning is small and frequent, so a fast small model is ideal and keeps your subscription/quota for the real work. Any OpenAI-compatible backend works; set it once and it's used for every run:

```bash
# Groq — free tier, very fast (good default for planning)
rinne config conductor groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile --key <GROQ_API_KEY>

# Cloudflare Workers AI — free daily tier
rinne config set conductor.account_id <ACCOUNT_ID>
rinne config conductor cloudflare @cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast --key <CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN>

# NVIDIA NIM — trial credits
rinne config conductor nvidia <model-id> --key <NVIDIA_API_KEY>

# Local Ollama — fully offline, no key
rinne config conductor local qwen2.5-coder
```

The token goes to your OS keychain (never the config file). Custom OpenAI-compatible host? Set `base_url` and `key_env` directly:

```bash
rinne config set conductor.backend groq
rinne config set conductor.base_url https://your-host/v1
rinne config set conductor.model your-model
rinne config key <TOKEN>          # stores it for the current conductor backend
```

After setting one, `rinne config` shows `Conductor … key present (keychain)` and planning runs there — independent of which harnesses you have installed.

## Requirements

- **Rust 1.85+** (edition 2021) and Cargo, to build from source.
- **macOS, Linux, or Windows** terminal. The interactive TUI needs a real TTY; otherwise use headless `-p`.
- **At least one worker**, which is one of:
  - a supported harness CLI installed and logged in (e.g. `claude`), **or**
  - an API key for any OpenAI-compatible provider.
- **A conductor backend** (optional but recommended): a Cloudflare/Groq/NVIDIA key, a local Ollama, or — by default — any installed harness as fallback.
- An **OS keychain** for persistent key storage (macOS Keychain, libsecret on Linux, Windows Credential Manager). If unavailable, fall back to environment variables.

Rinne stores its working state under `.rinne/` in the project directory (plans, progress, logs).

## Install & build

### Prebuilt binary (recommended)

Download the archive for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/GIKSN-RESEARCH/Rinne/releases/latest),
unpack it, and put `rinne` on your `PATH`:

```bash
# macOS (Apple Silicon) example — adjust the asset name for your platform
curl -L -o rinne.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/GIKSN-RESEARCH/Rinne/releases/latest/download/rinne-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
tar -xzf rinne.tar.gz
sudo mv rinne-aarch64-apple-darwin/rinne /usr/local/bin/
```

Each release publishes archives for macOS (arm64 + x86_64), Linux (x86_64), and
Windows (x86_64), each with a `.sha256` checksum.

### Build from source

```bash
# from the repository root
cargo build --release
# the binary lands at:
./target/release/rinne
```

Put it on your `PATH` (optional):

```bash
cargo install --path crates/rinne-cli
```

Run it:

```bash
rinne          # interactive TUI
rinne --help   # all commands
```

## First-run setup

```bash
# 1. See what Rinne can already use, and each worker's auth mode.
rinne doctor

# 2a. Connect a harness — Rinne holds no credentials; you log in natively.
rinne connect claude-code        # prints the native login hint

# 2b. Or connect an API provider — the key is stored in your OS keychain (once).
rinne connect deepseek <API_KEY>
rinne connect openrouter <API_KEY> --model openai/gpt-4o-mini

#     Any OpenAI-compatible host via --base-url:
rinne connect mycorp <API_KEY> --base-url https://llm.mycorp.com/v1 --model my-model

# 3. (Optional) point the conductor at a cheap planner and store its token.
rinne config conductor cloudflare @cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast --key <TOKEN>
#     plus the account id Cloudflare needs to build its URL:
rinne config set conductor.account_id <ACCOUNT_ID>

# 4. Verify.
rinne config        # shows resolved config + conductor key status
rinne models openrouter   # list models a provider key can reach
```

Then just run `rinne` and describe what you want.

## Using Rinne

### Interactive (TUI)

```bash
rinne
```

You get an inline harness: the transcript flows into your terminal's normal scrollback, and a small live region at the bottom holds the plan tree, the active worker's stream, conductor narration, and the prompt. Type a goal and press Enter. Use `@` to reference files. Use `/` for commands (Tab completes them).

```
 › @src/api.ts add Redis rate limiting and prove it works. Use deepseek as evaluator.
 · planning…
 · Plan:
     ○ n1  generator
     ○ n2  evaluator
 · routed n1 (Generator) to claude-code [harness]
 ▶ n1 → claude-code
   ⎿ n1  reading src/api.ts, package.json
   ⎿ n1  adding src/middleware/rateLimit.ts
 ✔ n1 succeeded
 ▶ n2 → deepseek
 ...
```

### Headless (scriptable)

```bash
# stream human-readable progress
rinne -p "summarize the architecture in ARCH.md"

# emit a single JSON result (for piping into other tools)
rinne -p "list the public API of src/lib.rs" --json
```

`rinne -p` makes Rinne itself a worker inside another system.

## Command reference

### Global

```bash
rinne                       # interactive TUI
rinne -p "<task>"           # headless one-shot, streams human-readable progress
rinne -p "<task>" --json    # headless, emits one JSON result (scriptable)
rinne --help                # all commands
rinne <command> --help      # options for one command
rinne --version
```

Global flags (valid on any command): `-p/--prompt <task>`, `--json`, `-v/--verbose` (repeatable, e.g. `-vv`; logs go to `.rinne/logs/`, never the TUI).

### `rinne doctor`

```bash
rinne doctor                # detect installed workers, auth mode, and quota
```

### `rinne connect` — set up a worker

```
rinne connect <backend> [key] [--model <id>]… [--base-url <url>] [--add]
```

| Form | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `rinne connect claude-code` | Harness: print the native login hint (Rinne holds no harness creds) |
| `rinne connect <provider> <key>` | API provider from the built-in catalog; key → OS keychain |
| `rinne connect <provider> <key> --model <id>` | …and set the model |
| `rinne connect <provider> <key> --model a --model b` | …a cheap→strong model ladder (repeat `--model`) |
| `rinne connect <name> <key> --base-url <url> --model <id>` | Any OpenAI-compatible host under a custom name |
| `rinne connect <provider> <key2> --add` | Add another key to the provider's rotation pool |
| `rinne connect <provider>` | No key → printed instructions for providing one |

```bash
# examples
rinne connect claude-code
rinne connect deepseek sk-…                                   # catalog provider (base_url known)
rinne connect openrouter sk-… --model openai/gpt-4o-mini
rinne connect openrouter sk-… --model llama-3.1-8b --model llama-3.3-70b   # ladder
rinne connect cloudflare <TOKEN> \
  --base-url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/ai/v1 \
  --model @cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast            # custom host
rinne connect mycorp <KEY> --base-url https://llm.mycorp.com/v1 --model my-model
rinne connect deepseek sk-second --add                        # 2nd key for rotation
```

Built-in API providers (base URL + key env preset): `openai`, `deepseek`, `gemini`, `nvidia`, `groq`, `openrouter`, `mistral`, `together`, `xai`. Harnesses: `claude-code`, `codex`, `opencode`, `grok`, `cursor-agent`, `aider`, `antigravity`.

### `rinne models` / `rinne forget`

```bash
rinne models openrouter     # list models the key can reach (cheapest first where priced)
rinne forget deepseek       # delete a stored API key from the keychain
```

### `rinne status` / `resume` / `run` / `logs`

```bash
rinne status                          # current run's DAG + progress
rinne resume --steer "use a 100/min window"   # inject guidance into a parked node
rinne resume --approve                # accept the parked state and continue
rinne resume --reject                 # throw out the approach and replan
rinne run plan.json                   # load a hand-written plan DAG and run it
rinne logs                            # view local trajectory logs
```

### `rinne config` — view/edit configuration

See [Configuration](#configuration) for the full subcommand reference. Everything there works identically as `rinne config <sub>` (shell) and `/config <sub>` (TUI).

### TUI slash commands

Inside the interactive harness, every CLI command above is also available as `/<command>`, plus run-control commands. Tab-completion suggests commands and `/config` subcommands as you type.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/connect <backend> [key] [--model <id>]… [--base-url <url>] [--add]` | Connect a harness or API provider (same as the CLI) |
| `/models <provider>` | List the models a provider key can access |
| `/forget <provider>` | Delete a stored API key |
| `/config [subcommand …]` | Show or edit configuration (see Configuration) |
| `/workers` (`/doctor`) | List workers + connected APIs and their auth |
| `/plan` | Show the current plan |
| `/steer <text>` | Inject guidance into a parked node (or just type while parked) |
| `/approve` · `/reject` | Accept the current state / throw it out and replan |
| `/pause` · `/resume` | Pause (state saved) / resume a paused run |
| `/budget <min>` | Adjust the time budget |
| `/route <n> <worker>` | Pin a node to a worker |
| `/logs` | Where logs are written (`.rinne/logs/`) |
| `/help` | Command reference |
| `/quit` (`/q`) | Exit |

### TUI keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `@` | Open the fuzzy file picker (`@path`, `@dir/`, `@glob`) |
| `Tab` | Accept the highlighted completion / file (chains to the next argument) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Recall previous / next prompt from history (persisted across sessions) |
| `← / →`, `Home`, `End` | Move the cursor; `Backspace` / `Delete` edit in place |
| `Ctrl+O` | Expand / collapse reasoning ("thinking") blocks |
| `Esc` | Dismiss a popup, or pause a running loop |
| `Ctrl+Q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |
| `Enter` | Submit the line |

## Configuration

Config is layered, lowest to highest precedence:

1. Built-in defaults (a zero-config install runs)
2. **Global** — `~/.config/rinne/config.toml` (Linux) / `~/Library/Application Support/rinne/config.toml` (macOS)
3. **Project** — `<repo>/.rinne/config.toml`
4. **Environment** — `RINNE_*` variables (e.g. `RINNE_CONDUCTOR_BACKEND=groq`)

Later layers override earlier ones field-by-field. Run `rinne config` to see the resolved result and the exact file paths on your machine.

### `config` subcommands (`rinne config …` = `/config …`)

Every subcommand works identically from the shell (`rinne config <sub>`) and inside the TUI (`/config <sub>`). Writes default to the **global** file; add `--project` to scope to the current repo, or `--global` to force global. Edits are **format-preserving** (comments survive) and **validated** before write — a bad key, type, or enum value is rejected with the valid options listed, and nothing is written. Secrets never touch the file (tokens go to the keychain).

| Subcommand | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| `config` · `config show` | Print the resolved config, conductor key status, and file paths |
| `config path` | Show the global + project config file locations |
| `config init` | Scaffold a fully-commented config file |
| `config edit` | Scaffold if needed, then open it in `$EDITOR` |
| `config conductor <backend> [model]` | Set the planner backend (and optionally its model) |
| `config conductor <backend> [model] --key <token>` | …and store its API token in the keychain |
| `config key <token>` | Store the API token for the **current** conductor backend |
| `config prefer <harness\|api\|balanced>` | Routing family order |
| `config role <role> <worker>` | Pin a role to a worker |
| `config model <worker> <model-id>` | Default model for a worker |
| `config set <dotted.key> <value>` | Set any field (type inferred: bool / int / string) |
| `config unset <dotted.key>` | Remove an override |

Conductor backends: `cloudflare` · `groq` · `nvidia` · `local` · `harness`. Roles: `planner` · `generator` · `evaluator` · `synthesizer` · `fixer`.

**Set up a conductor (all backends):**

```bash
# Cloudflare Workers AI (free daily tier) — needs the account id (for the URL) + token
rinne config set conductor.account_id <ACCOUNT_ID>
rinne config conductor cloudflare @cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast --key <CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN>

# Groq (free tier, fast — good default for planning)
rinne config conductor groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile --key <GROQ_API_KEY>

# NVIDIA NIM (trial credits)
rinne config conductor nvidia <model-id> --key <NVIDIA_API_KEY>

# Local Ollama (fully offline, no key)
rinne config conductor local qwen2.5-coder

# Cheapest installed harness as planner (no key; the default fallback)
rinne config conductor harness

# Any other OpenAI-compatible host
rinne config set conductor.backend groq
rinne config set conductor.base_url https://your-host/v1
rinne config set conductor.model your-model
rinne config key <TOKEN>          # stores it for the current conductor backend
```

**Every `config set` key:**

```bash
# [conductor]
rinne config set conductor.backend groq          # cloudflare|groq|nvidia|local|harness
rinne config set conductor.model llama-3.3-70b-versatile
rinne config set conductor.base_url https://your-host/v1
rinne config set conductor.account_id <ID>       # cloudflare only
rinne config set conductor.key_env MY_TOKEN_ENV  # override which env var holds the key

# [loop]
rinne config set loop.max_iterations_per_node 8
rinne config set loop.global_budget_minutes 120
rinne config set loop.test_ratchet true
rinne config set loop.stuck_loop_threshold 3

# [preferences]
rinne config prefer api                          # = set preferences.prefer (harness|api|balanced)
rinne config role evaluator openrouter           # = set preferences.roles.evaluator
rinne config set preferences.models.evaluator haiku

# default model per worker
rinne config model claude-code sonnet            # = set models.claude-code
```

Scope any of the above to one repo with `--project` (e.g. `rinne config conductor groq --project`).

### Schema

> Config uses strict parsing: a typo'd key (e.g. `[conducter]`) errors instead of being silently ignored. Secrets are **never** stored here.

## Secrets & auth

Rinne authenticates nothing and stores no key in plaintext.

- **Harness workers** own their own auth — you log in natively (`claude`, `codex login`, ...). Rinne just invokes the tool the way that honors that login.
- **API keys** (workers *and* the conductor) are resolved **env var first, then the OS keychain**. Store one persistently with `rinne connect <provider> <key>` or `/config conductor <backend> --key <token>`; it survives across shells. The config file only ever names the env var (`key_env`), never the value.
- **Multiple keys** per provider are supported — `connect ... --add` appends to a rotation pool that rotates on rate limits.
- `rinne config` reports the conductor key as `key present (env)` or `key present (keychain)` or `NO KEY`, without printing the secret. `(env)` means an exported variable is winning; store with `--key` and drop the export to get the persistent `(keychain)`.

### How key storage works (the keychain)

When you run `rinne connect <provider> <key>` (or `/config conductor <backend> --key <token>`), Rinne hands the key to your **operating system's keychain** — the same encrypted credential store your browser and OS use for passwords. It's the one place Rinne keeps a secret, and it's deliberately *not* Rinne's own file. Here's exactly what happens so nothing feels like a black box:

- **Where it goes, per OS:**
  - **macOS** → Keychain (Keychain Access app)
  - **Linux** → Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet via libsecret)
  - **Windows** → Credential Manager
- **How to find it.** Every entry is stored under the service name **`rinne`** with the **account = the provider name** (e.g. `deepseek`, `openrouter`, `cloudflare`). So on macOS you can open **Keychain Access**, search `rinne`, and see one item per provider — labelled, but with the value hidden behind your login. Nothing is in cleartext anywhere Rinne controls.
- **Encrypted by the OS, not by Rinne.** The key is sealed by your system's credential store and unlocked with your user login — Rinne just asks the OS for it at call time. Rinne never writes it to `config.toml`, logs, or the prompt history.
- **Multiple keys.** `connect ... --add` stores a **pool** (a JSON array under the same entry) that Rinne rotates across rate limits. `connect` without `--add` replaces the pool.
- **Resolution order.** At call time Rinne looks at the **environment variable first** (the `key_env` name, e.g. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`), then the **keychain**. So an exported env var transparently overrides the stored key for a one-off, and your existing env-var workflow is unchanged.
- **Inspect without revealing.** `rinne config` and `rinne workers` report `key present (keychain)` / `(env)` / `NO KEY` — they confirm a key is found and *where from*, never the value itself. Transcript echoes of `connect`/`--key` are redacted to `***`.
- **Remove it.** `rinne forget <provider>` deletes the entry from the keychain (or delete the `rinne` item directly in your OS keychain UI).
- **No keychain available?** On a headless box with no Secret Service, storage fails gracefully — Rinne tells you and falls back to `export <KEY_ENV>=<value>`. Nothing breaks; you just lose the "set once and forget" convenience.
- **Prompt history is safe too.** `.rinne/history` (used for ↑/↓ recall across sessions) filters out any command containing a key/token, so secrets never land there either.

This is a deliberate, documented exception to the "Rinne holds no credentials" principle: it exists so you can set a key once and forget it, while the secret stays in an OS-managed encrypted vault rather than a plaintext config file.

> **Billing footgun:** for `claude-code`, an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment overrides your subscription and bills the metered API account. `doctor` surfaces this; Rinne never silently bills.

## Routing & model selection

- Tiers and escalation ladders are computed from **whatever workers are actually present**, not hardcoded — single-family, single-API, multi-vendor, and mixed pools each route differently.
- The conductor assigns a role + capability + *optional* preferred worker; the scheduler resolves the concrete worker at dispatch from live availability and quota. A rate-limited preferred worker doesn't kill the node — it escalates/cascades.
- Evaluators are pushed toward **independence** from the generator (a different family/vendor where the pool allows it), so a model isn't just grading itself.
- Per-provider model ladders (cheap → strong) drive cascade escalation on evaluation failure; pricing metadata from `/v1/models` orders them where the platform reports it.
- Override anything: `prefer`, per-role pins, per-worker default models, or `/route <node> <worker>` live.

```

Runtime state lives under `.rinne/` in the working directory: the plan, run progress, and logs (`.rinne/logs/`).

## Development

```bash
cargo build            # debug build
cargo test             # full workspace test suite
cargo build --release  # optimized binary
rinne -vv -p "..."     # verbose logs to .rinne/ for debugging
```

The architecture has a deliberate constraint worth knowing: SQLite connections are `!Sync`, so the TUI runs the engine on a dedicated thread with a current-thread runtime, and intra-run parallelism is achieved by joining concurrent futures on that thread rather than spawning across threads.

### Cutting a release (maintainers)

Releases are **tag-triggered**: pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the `rinne` binary for macOS (arm64 + x86_64), Linux (x86_64), and Windows (x86_64), then publishes a GitHub Release with the archives, `.sha256` checksums, and **auto-generated, categorized notes** (see `.github/release.yml`).

```bash
# 1. Bump the version in the workspace Cargo.toml first (e.g. 0.1.5 → 0.1.6),
#    in BOTH [workspace.package].version and the internal rinne-* dep versions.
#    Commit that bump and merge it to main.

# 2. From the up-to-date main:
git checkout main && git pull

# 3. Tag with `v` + the Cargo.toml version, then push the tag:
git tag -a v0.1.6 -m "Rinne v0.1.6"
git push origin v0.1.6        # this fires the release workflow
```

The tag name **must** match the convention `v<version>` — the workflow only triggers on `v*`, and the tag should equal the `Cargo.toml` version. Pushing the tag requires push access to this repository.

Alternatives:

- **GitHub web UI:** Releases → *Draft a new release* → *Choose a tag* → type `v0.1.6` → *Create new tag on publish* → *Publish*.
- **Manual run (no tag from your machine):** Actions → *release* → *Run workflow* → enter the tag. The workflow's `workflow_dispatch` input handles this.

To redo a botched release, delete the tag and the GitHub Release, then re-tag:

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.6   # delete the remote tag
git tag -d v0.1.6                    # delete the local tag
# fix, re-tag, push again
```

Release notes are categorized by PR label; the `pr-label` workflow labels each PR from its conventional-commit title (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, …), so notes populate without manual labeling.

## Privacy & security

- No hosted component, no telemetry, no analytics, no auto-update. The only outbound network calls are to the workers and the conductor backend **you** configured.
- All state is local under `.rinne/`. The config file is safe to commit or share — it contains no secrets.
- Keys live in the OS keychain (encrypted) or environment variables you control. `/forget <provider>` removes a stored key.
- Transcript secrets (API keys passed to `connect`, tokens passed via `--key`) are redacted in the on-screen feed.

## Roadmap

Deferred to a later version (not in v0.1):

- **ACP transport** — JSON-RPC over stdio for workers that expose it cleanly (today: subprocess-json for harnesses, HTTP for APIs).
- **Learned router** — replace prompted worker-selection with a router trained offline on logged trajectories (chosen worker, role, eval result, cost, latency). Planning stays prompted longer.
- **git-worktree parallelism** for isolated concurrent file edits.

Non-goals: a SaaS, a subscription multiplexer/reseller, an IDE/GUI driver. A worker must expose a headless surface to be supported.
